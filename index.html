                <h3>Guest Lists</h3>
                <p>Once you create your event, you can manage your guest list. Keep track of how many guest you invite and how many people plan on attending. A great way to get a head count as you plan the rest of your party details.</p>

                <h3>Check Lists</h3>
                <p>Forgot to buy the streamers? That won't happen with our Shopping and To Do Lists! Create a To Do List to make sure you don't forget to do all those important things before the party day arrives. Ready to buy all the necessary items for your event? Add everything to our Shopping List and mark off each item as they're purchased. It even links to our budget tracker so you can input a price so it keeps track of your spending! </p>

                <h3>Budget Tracker</h3>
                <p>Set a budget for each event. We know parties can add up pretty quick. Our budget tracker allows you to set a budget for your event before you begin your shopping. As you purchase things off your shopping list, it will automatically deduct from your party budget, letting you know how much is left to spend.</p>
